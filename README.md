# DataScience-Climbing

The data I used for this analysis is from the 8a.nu dataset that can be downloaded on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dcohen21/8anu-climbing-logbook).

## Average Progression
Analyse the progression of boulderers based on the average of the three hardest boulders each year. Experience is calculated as the difference between the year a user started climbing and the year of an ascent.
